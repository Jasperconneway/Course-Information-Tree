# Course-Information-Tree
## Final Project: Category Two Narrative
The artifact is my project from CS 300. The project consists of one file that parses a text file of course information. The course information in the text file is separated by commas so the methods to parse this 
information do so with comma delimiter. The project was created in April of 2024. 

I selected this artifact because it fits the algorithm and data structure category. The parsing file before was not complete and I added the Course structure and Node structure, the class and additional methods to 
build the binary search tree. The methods to build the binary search tree and parse the file showcase my abilities in algorithms and data structures. 

I did meet the course outcomes I planned which were course outcomes 3 and 4. There were some inconsistency in the printing methods I noticed, but I fixed this by clearing the old data from the course prerequisites 
before parsing a new course. 
- Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in
design choices.  

- Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry
specific goals.

While I enhanced this artifact, I realized it wasnâ€™t going to be easy to search through the binary search tree by course title and may be unrealistic. Most of the methods I created or enhanced in the file use 
recursion and a course title could be inside any left or right node. Without the course number, I cannot compare information to being smaller or larger to determine where the title would be. While I wanted to 
implement the suggestions for this category, I ran out of time working on category three. I did, however, fix the print method inconsistencies.
